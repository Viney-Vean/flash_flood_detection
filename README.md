# Flash Flood Detection
Tackling flash floods using AI and machine learning involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. Below is an example of a Python script that uses machine learning to predict flash floods based on meteorological data. This script will use a simple machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to make predictions.

1. Data Collection: Gather historical meteorological data (rainfall, temperature, humidity, etc.) and flood occurrence data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
3. Model Training: Train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of flash floods.
4. Model Deployment: Use the trained model to make real-time predictions.


For a real-world application, you would also need to handle more aspects such as data storage, model updating, and integration with alert systems.
